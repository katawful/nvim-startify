# nvim-startify
This is a Neovim plugin designed to replicate the look and feel of [vim-startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify) while also giving the users a flexible, yet easy to understand, API to expand this.

# Status
This project is not in any sort of development status.
It is considered incomplete on all fronts.
Use of this plugin is only considered for development needs.
Until a phase of development begins, do not expect response as a non-contributor.

# Development
This plugin is planned to be developed in 3 phases:

- Alpha
- Beta
- Release

#### Alpha
This phase indicates that full [vim-startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify) is being tested.
While no new features of the plugin will be implemented (unless the plugin needs it), expect to have a vim-startify like use out of the plugin while bugs are squashed.
This phase will move on once all features of vim-startify are dealt with.

#### Beta
This phase indicates that full [vim-startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify) is done being tested, and that new features can be added to the plugin.
These currently include:

- [ ] More built in objects
- [ ] vim-startify detection for added compatibility
- [ ] Color animations

#### Release
This is the final release.
This will mainly target bugs and documentation.
